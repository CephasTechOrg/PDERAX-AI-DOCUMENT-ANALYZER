SUMMARY:
--------------------
This document presents financial data for seven individuals across different occupations in Ghana, showing their monthly and annual income, expenses, and savings. The data reveals significant income disparities between professions, with engineers and accountants earning substantially more than teachers, nurses, drivers, traders, and students. All individuals maintain positive savings, indicating they live within their means, though savings rates vary considerably across income levels.

The highest earner is Kojo Owusu (Engineer) with GHS 7,200 monthly income and GHS 2,400 monthly savings, while the lowest earner is Kofi Adjei (Student) with GHS 1,200 monthly income and GHS 200 monthly savings. The data shows a clear correlation between income level and absolute savings amount, though savings rates (savings as percentage of income) differ. Annual figures are consistently 12 times the monthly amounts, confirming straightforward monthly-to-annual calculations.

KEY INSIGHTS:
--------------------
1. Income inequality is evident: Engineer's monthly income (GHS 7,200) is 6x Student's income (GHS 1,200)
2. All subjects maintain positive cash flow (income > expenses)
3. Highest savings rate: Engineer (33.3% of income saved)
4. Lowest savings rate: Driver (21.4% of income saved)
5. Trader shows surprisingly high income (GHS 5,000 monthly), comparable to professional occupations
6. Student maintains the lowest absolute savings (GHS 200 monthly) despite modest expenses
7. Annual figures are calculated by simple multiplication (monthly × 12)
