SUMMARY:
--------------------
 This document serves as a comprehensive quick reference guide for PostgreSQL database operations, covering fundamental commands across multiple functional areas. The guide begins with database connection and management commands, including how to connect to databases, create new databases, and delete existing ones. It then progresses to table operations, detailing table creation with specific column definitions and constraints, table deletion, and methods for examining table structures. The document further expands into data manipulation operations, providing essential commands for viewing, sorting, and filtering data using SELECT statements with ORDER BY and WHERE clauses. It demonstrates how to insert new records into tables and execute external SQL files. The sorting section shows both single and multiple column sorting capabilities, while the filtering section illustrates complex conditional logic using AND/OR operators and parentheses for grouping conditions. Additional features covered include selecting specific columns instead of all data and using DISTINCT to eliminate duplicate values from query results. The reference concludes with helpful meta-commands for accessing PostgreSQL's built-in help system, making it a practical tool for both beginners and experienced users who need quick access to common PostgreSQL operations. The examples provided are clear and contextually relevant, particularly the patient database examples that demonstrate real-world application scenarios for the various commands and clauses.

KEY INSIGHTS:
--------------------
1. PostgreSQL provides both SQL commands and meta-commands (starting with backslash) for different types of operations
2. The WHERE clause supports complex logical conditions using AND/OR operators with parentheses for proper grouping
3. Multiple sorting criteria can be applied simultaneously with different sort directions (ASC/DESC)
4. The DISTINCT keyword is essential for eliminating duplicate values in query results
5. External SQL files can be executed directly within PostgreSQL using the \i meta-command
6. Help systems are built directly into PostgreSQL with \? for meta-commands and \h for SQL commands
7. Table structure examination is facilitated through the \d and \d table_name commands
