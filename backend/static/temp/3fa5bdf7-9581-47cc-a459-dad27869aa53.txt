SUMMARY:
--------------------
This document serves as the official confirmation of submission for a DS-160 Nonimmigrant Visa Application filed by Cephas Osei Bonsu, a Ghanaian national born on October 20, 2004, in Kumasi. The application, completed on October 29, 2025, pertains to an F1 student visa, with the processing location designated as the U.S. Embassy in Accra, Ghana. The confirmation number AA00F4ATEB and passport number G5336914 are key identifiers for tracking the application, though the document explicitly states it does not constitute a visa itself. The confirmation outlines critical next steps in the visa application process, emphasizing that submission of the DS-160 is merely the initial phase. Applicants must review embassy-specific instructions, schedule an interview (unless exempt), and prepare required documents, including the confirmation page, passport, I-20 form, SEVIS fee receipt, and proof of fee payments. The document underscores the importance of bringing these materials to all application stages and highlights that additional supporting documents may strengthen the case. Legal and procedural obligations are thoroughly detailed, including the necessity of providing a biometric signature during the interview, certifying the truthfulness of all information under penalty of perjury. The document warns that false statements could lead to permanent visa refusal, exclusion from the U.S., or deportation. It also notes that applicant data, including fingerprints and photographs, may be shared with government agencies for law enforcement and immigration purposes, reinforcing the seriousness of the application process.
